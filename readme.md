### Motivation
Crime is a normal part of societies. Many recourses are assigned to monitor, address, and prevent crimes. Crime could have huge cost on individuals. Their costs could affect individuals physically and mentally. I believe analyzing crime data could give insights about the crime trends.

### Summary
In this blog we have investigated three questions related to the crimes in Boston. We have found out that 2017 was the highest year in number of crimes. n addition, B2 and C11 were the top 2 districts in number of crimes. Finally, the top crime every year was the Motor Vehicle Accident Assistance. We have noticed several interesting trends that could be investigated in future works.
